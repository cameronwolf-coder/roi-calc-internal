## Writing Rules

### Never Start Content With

- "Hi [Name]," or any greeting
- "Hope this email finds you well"
- "I wanted to reach out"
- "Just checking in"
- Any personalization token as opener

**Start with value instead.**

### Never Use These Words/Phrases

| Banned | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Revolutionary, game-changing, disruptive | Buzzwords kill credibility |
| AI-powered, AI-driven (in positioning) | -38% reply rate |
| All-in-one, single pane of glass | Generic vendor speak |
| Best-in-class, world-class, cutting-edge | Empty superlatives |
| Leverage, utilize | Use "use" instead |
| Synergy, seamless | Overused to meaninglessness |
| "I'd love to..." | Too salesy |
| "What sparked your interest?" | Marketing speak |
| "Looking forward to partnering..." | Premature |

### Never Use Em Dashes

Use hyphen (-), period (.), or comma (,) instead of em dash (-)

### Always Use

- **Direct questions:** "What's your fraud rate?"
- **Specific metrics:** "60% cost reduction" not "improve efficiency"
- **Customer names with results:** "CrossCountry saved $10M"
- **Industry terminology:** "R&W relief", "DU Validation Service", "pull-through rate"
- **Permission-based CTAs:** "Worth 15 minutes?" not "Let's schedule a call"

## Tone by Content Type

### Cold Outreach
- **Tone:** Direct, peer-level, permission-based
- **Structure:** REASON + PROBLEM + VALUE + CTA (no greeting)
- **Example:** "Saw [Company] originated $2B in loans last quarter. Most lenders at your scale face buyback risk from stale verification data. We help Top 20 mortgage banks eliminate rep & warranty risk and cut verification costs 60%. Worth 30 minutes?"

### Product Updates
- **Tone:** Technical, achievement-focused, concise
- **Approach:** List features with specific metrics
- **Example:** "Deposit-based Verification of Employment (DVOE) now available. Conversion improved 40.51% to 62.66%."

### Educational Content
- **Tone:** Helpful expert, dual-audience (borrowers + lenders)
- **Approach:** Explain pain points, provide guidance, subtly position Truv
- **Example:** "Manual verification takes several weeks. Consumer-permissioned verification completes in less than 1 minute on average."

### Thought Leadership
- **Tone:** Consultative, acknowledges real barriers
- **Approach:** Position as understanding the human side of technology adoption
- **Example:** "Loan officers resist digital verification not due to technical issues, but because they fear disruption to established processes."

### Cost Challenge Content
- **Tone:** Direct challenger, confrontational toward incumbents
- **Approach:** Use specific math, question legacy pricing
- **Example:** "Why does a simple verification still cost more than dinner for two?"
